TODO

- Add --keep-alive option remaining open; used in conjunction with exec to
    fork/exec new processes.  Only applicable in listen mode (borrowed from ncat)
- Add UDP support (-u)
- Make commandline arguments better mirror nc arguments
- Add -w (timeout) option
- Add IPv6 support (-6)

ACCOMPLISHED
- Make command line argument parsing more flexible
    (ie, hostname shouldn't be required all the time)
- Add --exec option for executing a program on connection (borrowed from ncat)
